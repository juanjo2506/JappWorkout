    <h2>about the website</h2>
    <p>this website is created with purpose of not just giving a valuable information about calisthenic and streetlifting, but in order to help all those people who love to working out like me, to count their sets as measuring the time between sets, pointing always in having an efficient training. On the main page, you can choose from different options. Each option provides recommendations for sets and reps based on your level <strong>(One Rep Max or Max bodyweight pull ups in a row)</strong>, whether you're training with bodyweight or streetlifting.
    You should know that this website is subject to changes in the future, hence, it will be improved over time and new features will be implemented in order to provide better information and higher-quality results.
